摘要: Data heterogeneity is common across many high-impact real applications, ranging from security to manufacturing, from healthcare to traffic analytics, and it is closely related to the 'Variety' aspect of big data. Such heterogeneity can be presented in a variety of forms, including task heterogeneity, where multiple related tasks may form a hierarchical structure; view heterogeneity, where information is being collected from various sources; instance heterogeneity, where the label of a single example can be decomposed into a set of heterogeneous labels associated with composing instances; etc. In this talk, I will introduce how we model data heterogeneity from a holistic perspective. In particular, I will hinge on multiple applications, discuss the major challenges being shared by these applications that are related to data heterogeneity, and introduce our proposed techniques for addressing these challenges.
