报告摘要：
    Differential Evolution (DE) is arguably one of the most powerful stochastic real-parameter optimization algorithms of current interest. DE operates through similar computational steps as employed by a standard Evolutionary Algorithm (EA). However, unlike
traditional EAs, the DE variants perturb the current-generation population members with the scaled differences of distinct population members. Therefore, no separate probability distribution has to be used for generating the offspring. Since its inception in 1995, DE has drawn the attention of many researchers all over the world resulting in a lot of variants of the basic algorithm with improved performance. This talk will begin with a brief but comprehensive overview of the basic concepts related to DE, its algorithmic components and control parameters. It will subsequently discuss some of the significant algorithmic variants of DE for bound constrained single-objective optimization. Application of the DE family of algorithms in complex optimization scenarios like constrained, large-scale, dynamic and multi-modal optimization problems will also be included. The talk will finally highlight a few open research problems.
