Abstract: During the last 15 years automated image analysis has invaded research in cell biology in such a way that it now has become fully part of it. In this talk, we will visit a few example of image analysis approaches we designed to address computational biology challenges. We will describe a multi target tracking algorithm we developed to study the HIV virus dynamic during infection. We will also show how the miniaturization of samples and the full automation of their analysis led to process half million cell based conditions in parallel to discover therapeutic targets or decipher the mechanism of action of a drug. We will also show that both approaches can be combine to operate tracking on a large number of miniaturized experiment. Then we will describe an approach we are developing to make possible analysis of irregular tissue samples.
报告人简介：
Auguste Genovesio leads the Scientific Center for Computational Biology at the Institute of Biology of Ecole Normale Superieure (IBENS). After a PhD conducted at the Pasteur Institute, he has led research effort in South Korea (Institute Pasteur Korea), in the USA (Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard) and now in France (IBENS). Auguste Genovesio has a background in mathematics and computer science and he is specialized in image analysis and large-scale data analysis. He has spent the last 15 years developing this type of method to quantify or demonstrate biological phenomena and actively participated in the development of high-content screening technologies. He is author of 6 patents (therapeutic targets for HIV, Anti tubercular compound and computational methods) and 55 scientific papers (in journals such as Nature, Nature methods and IEEE transaction on image processing).
