六、内容简介： 
   Over the last decade, differential privacy (DP) has emerged as the standard privacy notion for research in privacy-preserving data analysis and publishing. However, there is an ongoing debate about the meaning and value of DP. Some hail that the notion of DP offers strong privacy protection regardless of the adversary's prior knowledge while enabling all kinds of data analysis. Others offer criticisms regarding DP's privacy guarantee and utility limitations. In this talk we explore the meanings of DP, trying to answer the question: "Under what condition(s), the notion of DP delivers the promised privacy guarantee?" We show that the answer is quite nuanced and depends on legal and ethical considerations that need to be discussed by the community.
