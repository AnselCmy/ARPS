Biography：
张娟娟本科毕业于新加坡南洋理工大学，获得美国卡内基梅隆大学和新加坡南洋理工大学双博士学位，她主要的工作是上肢和下肢康复机器人的人机交互控制与稳定性研究。Juanjuan Zhang received her B.Eng from Nanyang Technological University of Singapore with a major in Electrical and Electronic Engineering and a minor in Computing. She finished her Dual Ph.D. Programme held by Carnegie Mellon University, USA, and Nanyang Technological University, Singapore in August 2016, which earned her one M.S. and two independant Ph.D. degrees: one in Mechanical Engineering from Carnegie Mellon and the other in Electrical & Electronic Engineering from Nanyang. She is currently working as a postdoctoral researcher in Experimental Biomechatronics Lab of Carnegie Mellon.

Abstract：
Robotic devices have been used in post-stroke or trauma neurorehabilitation process for years. Due to the uncertain, complex, and changing physical human-robot-interaction dynamics involved and task-specific objectives for rehabilitation, control of this type of devices remains a vast area of research. My PhD research seeks systematicness in rehabilitation robot control design by developing control frameworks for upper- and low-limb rehabilitation devices that can be generally applied on multiple devices, using theoretical and experimental methodologies. My research examines the control difficulties and provides solutions for two specific groups of rehabilitation robots that are widely used: the upper-limb rehabilitation robot for reaching and tracking tasks that consists of a robot arm linked to human arm in series, and the powered ankle exoskeleton for human gait training. To address systematic control for these two groups of robots, my prior research investigated several separate problems. In one study, I developed a stable control architecture for upper-limb rehabilitation robots that automatically provides training to different patients at different stages while ensuring human safety. In another project, I developed a robust torque control framework for robotic legged locomotion systems like lower-limb exoskeletons, prostheses and walking robots, and optimized control conditions and device mechanical properties to further improve torque tracking. I also developed an online optimization system for exoskeleton and prostheses high level controllers that greatly reduced human metabolic costs.Besides previous work, I will also share my future research interests in the field of wearable robots and robotic legged locomotion.
