(wenjli@cityu.edu.hk)The resolution of optical microscopes has been constrained by Ernst Abbe’s limit of diffraction to 200–250nm under visible light illumination since the 17th Century.  The invention of the Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) about 80 years ago and Scanning Tunneling Microscope/Atomic Force Microscope (STM/AFM) about 35 years have made tremendous breakthroughs in observing and analyzing sub-diffraction scale features. Although non-optical technologies such as the SEM can provide resolution much beyond the optical diffraction limit, they are still mostly not compatible with real-time and non-destructive imaging (especially for biological samples) requirements, and therefore, a non-invasive and non-destructive imaging technology that can break the diffraction limit is still in demand. In this lecture, we will present a novel time-efficient and non-invasive microsphere-based scanning superlens microscopy (SSUM) method that enables the observation of biological and non-bioligical samples over a large area with sub-diffraction limited resolution.  This technology operates in both non-invasive and contact modes with approximately 200 times the acquisition efficiency of atomic force microscopy.  Our method marks a path to non-invasive structural resolution and the simultaneous tracking of specific molecules with nanoscale resolution, facilitating the study of subcellular events over a total cell period.BioWen J. Li (BSc/MSc, Univ. of Southern California, and PhD, UCLA) is Chair Professor of Biomedical Engineering in the Dept. of Mechanical and Biomedical Engineering of the City University of Hong Kong (CityU).  He is currently the President of the IEEE Nanotechnology Council and Director of the Institute for Intelligent Cyber Physical Sensing Syesms of the Shenzhen Academy of Robotics, China.  Prior to joining CityU, he was with The Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK; 1997-2011), where he headed the Centre for Micro and Nano Systems. He held research positions at the NASA/CalTech Jet Propulsion Laboratory, The Aerospace Corporation, and Silicon Microstructures before moving to Hong Kong in 1997.  His team has published more than 300 technical papers related to MEMS/nanotechnology and received best conference/student paper awards from prestigious conferences such as IEEE-ICRA, IEEE/ASME AIM, IEEE-ROBIO, and IEEE-NANO in the past 15 years.  Dr. Li served as the Editor-in-Chief of the IEEE Nanotechnology Magazine (2007 to 2013) and is an Editorial Board Member of Scientific Reports.   Dr. Li was elected IEEE Fellow in 2010 and ASME Fellow in 2011; he was also a Distinguished Overseas Scholar of the Chinese Academy of Sciences.  His current research interest includes super-resolution nanoscopy, cyber physical sensors, and micro/nano robotics for biomedical applications.
