Speaker：
Dr. Jizhong Xiao, ProfessorDepartment of Electrical EngineeringDirector of CCNY Robotics Lab and PRISM CenterThe City College and Graduate Center of City University of New York
ABSTRACTDr. Xiao’s robotics group at The City College, City University of New York (CCNY/CUNY City College) has been conducting research in the following directions: 1) mobility, 2) autonomy, 3) assistive technology, 4) intelligent mechatronics systems, 5) multi-agent/multi-robot systems. This talk will highlight two recent research projects conducted at the CCNY Robotics Lab: 1) Autonomous Navigation and 3D SLAM (simultaneous localization and mapping) of micro aerial vehicles (MAV) in cluttered environments, and 2) Assistive Navigation to help blind people. In the first part of the talk, I will introduce our effort in tackling the important challenges of MAV perception, control and mapping, including real-time pose estimation and 3D SLAM using laser scanner, fast visual odometry and 3D mapping using RGB-D sensor, and single camera omni-vision system for MAV perception. The second part of the talk will introduce the Intelligent Situation Awareness and Navigation Aid (ISANA) that helps the blind persons to achieve independent travel in multi-floor buildings. Lastly, I will introduce the opportunities for students who are interesting in pursuing advanced degrees at CUNY City College due to the expansion of the CCNY robotics research program.

Biography：
Dr. Jizhong Xiao is a Professor and PhD program advisor at the Department of Electrical Engineering of the City College, City University of New York (CCNY/CUNY City College), as well as a doctoral faculty member of the Ph.D. program in Computer Science at the CUNY Graduate Center. He received his Ph.D. degree from the Michigan State University in 2002, Master of Engineering degree from Nanyang Technological University, Singapore in 1999, M.S, and B.S. degrees from the East China Institute of Technology, Nanjing, China, in 1993 and 1990, respectively.  He started the Robotics Research Program at the City College in 2002 and is the Founding Director of CCNY Robotics Laboratory (website: http://robotics.ccny.cuny.edu) and the Center for Perceptual Robotics, Intelligent Sensors and Machines (PRISM Center). With his leadership, the robotics research has become one of the most active and well-funded research directions in the EE department of CCNY. His current research interests include robotics and control, cyber-physical systems, autonomous navigation and 3D simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM), real-time and embedded computing, assistive technology, multi-agent systems and swarm robotics. He has published more than 140 research articles in peer reviewed journal and conferences. Dr. Xiao received the U.S. National Science Foundation CAREER Award in 2007 and the CCNY Outstanding Mentoring Award in 2011, and Humboldt Research Fellowship for Experienced Researchers from the Alexander von Humboldt Foundation, Germany in 2013~2015.
