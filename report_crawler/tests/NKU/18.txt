Abstract：
As a fundamental tool for discovering genes involved in a disease or biological process, differential gene expression analysis plays an important role in genomics research. High throughput sequencing technologies such as RNA-Seq are increasingly being used for differential gene expression analysis which was dominated by the microarray technology in the past decade. However, inferring differentially expressed genes based on the observed difference of RNA-Seq read counts has unique challenges that were not present in microarray-based analysis. An RNA-Seq based differential expression analysis may be biased against genes with low read counts since the difference between genes with high read counts is more easily detected. Moreover, analyses that do not take into account alternative splicing often miss genes that have differentially expressed transcripts. In this talk, we introduce two novel methods for enhancing differential expression analysis. One uses a markov random field (MRF) model to integrate RNA-Seq data with coexpression data and the other represents independent alternative splicing events by decomposing the splice graph of a gene into special modules (called alternative splicing modules or ASMs). Our extensive experiments on simulated data and real data with qPCR validation demonstrate that these enhancements lead to more sensitive differential expression analyses and better classification of cancer subtypes, cell types and cell-cycle phases. This is joint work with Ei-Wen Yang and Thomas Girke.
