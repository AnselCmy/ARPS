Biography：
Chengqing Li received his M.Sc. degreein Applied Mathematics from Zhejiang University, China in 2005 and his Ph.D.degree in Electronic Engineering from City University of Hong Kong in 2008.Thereafter, he had been working as a Postdoctoral Fellow at The Hong KongPolytechnic University till September 2010. He is working at the College ofInformation Engineering, Xiangtan University, China as a Professor, where hereceived his Bachelor degree in Mathematics before. From April 2013 to July2014, he worked at University of Konstanz, Germany, under the support of theAlexander von Humboldt Foundation. Dr Li focuses on security analysis of imageand chaos-based encryption schemes. He has published more than forty papers onthe subject in the past ten years.


Abstract：
Security and privacy of image data are seriousconcern of every person living in the cyber world. To solve the change, a greatnumber of image encryption and protection schemes were proposed in the past twodecades. This talk will review the design ideas and security of most typicalimage encryption schemes from the perspective of cryptanalysis. Representativesecurity problems and the contradictions among the related key factors, such asefficiency, security level, and usability, will be introduced. This talk willalso try to clarify the relationship between security and image processingtechniques.
