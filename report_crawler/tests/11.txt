报告摘要：
This presentation discusses the role of modelling and system identification (SID) in advancedprocess control. Modelling and SID are more important in the 21st century than it has everbeen, given that the process industry appears to be evolving towards “lights-out processcontrol” − processes that are fully automated and that require no human operators on-site.This evolution is part of a larger trend where human mental power is increasingly beingreplaced by digital technologies. Some background material is provided to illustrate thesetrends.
Modelling and SID play an important role in establishing and maintaining a successfuladvanced process controller for an industrial process. Some examples are given from amineral process industry perspective, in particular for grinding mill circuits. Such circuits aregenerally difficult to control due to the presence of strong external disturbances, poor processmodels and the unavailability of important process variable measurements. Some historicaland current examples of modelling for grinding mill control are highlighted.
Vendors and academics have and are busy developing tools for the autonomous maintenanceof advanced process control systems, such as MPC controllers. These “lights-out processcontrol” tools, which are peripheral to the controller and mostly based on process models,show promise, but more work is required before complete autonomy can be achieved. Someexamples of such tools are given as applied to grinding mill control loops. The presentationconcludes with some future research challenges.
