Abstract：
Learnings from different data sources can often be fused together to yield more powerful findings than those from individual sources alone.  This talk presents a new fusion learning approach, named “iFusion”, for drawing efficient individual inference by fusing leanings from relevant data sources. This iFusion is robust for handling heterogeneity arising from diverse sources in big data, and is ideally suited for goal-directed applications such as precision medicine. Specifically, iFusion summarizes individual inference information in confidence distributions (CDs), then adaptively forms a clique of individuals that bear relevance to the target individual, and finally combines the CDs from those relevant individuals and draws inference for the target individual from the combined CD. In essence, iFusion “borrows strength” from relevant individuals to improve efficiency while retaining inference validity. Computationally, iFusion is parallel in nature and scales up well to big data in comparison with existing competitors. Examples in simulations and real applications in financial forecasting are presented. (Joint work with Jieli Shen and Regina Liu)
