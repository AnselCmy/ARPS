Abstract：
With heavy investment on higher education, governments and societies start to look into how to assess the performance and return on investment. Various university ranking system look into different criteria and government agencies start to evaluate the development of disciplines. Australia Research Council (ARC) introduced the scheme of Excellence of Research Australia since 2008. The practice has been implemented for 4 times (ERA2008, ERA2010, ERA2012 and ERA2015). The talk is to introduce how research performance in computer science discipline is examined and impacts to researchers, scholars and students.
