Abstract：
Vortex based simulation methods can produce attractive visual effects, so most favored to enhance the dynamic smoke simulation. However, using such physical models is still a challenging task to efficiently and stably reproduce high-quality smoke, as the motion is influenced by all other vortex elements in the simulation domain in which vortex stretching and the complex evolution are hard to tackle. In this work, we present the novel hybrid vortex model that seamlessly fuses the vortex filament and vortex particle in one system to efficiently simulate stable and scalable dynamic smokes. We first introduce the vortex filaments in grids scheme, in which the grids dynamically bridge the motion of vortex filaments and smoke particles for efficient smoke simulation with fine visual effects. We further work on converting the vortex filament when overly stretched into vortex particles while maintaining the total circulation, which effectively stabilizes the simulator. We also realize the parallel processing of hybrid vortex model on the modern GPU, so further improving the simulation efficiency. The experimental results demonstrated that our hybrid scheme enables producing the visual plausibility with diffusive and highly turbulent smoke effects, as well as the flexibility for scale of details and efficient simulation performance.
