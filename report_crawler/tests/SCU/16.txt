Abstract：
This work proposes an automated system for real-time high-accuracy detection of cerebral embolic signals (ES) to couple with transcranial Doppler ultrasound (TCD) devices in diagnosing a risk of stroke. The algorithm employs Adaptive Gain Control (AGC) approach to capture suspected ESs in real-time. Then, Adaptive Wavelet Packet Transform (AWPT) and Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) are used to extract from them features most efficiently representing ES, which determined by Sequential Feature Selection technique. Extracted feature vectors from the suspected ESs are later determined whether they are of an ES or non-ES interval by Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) based classifier. The effectiveness of the developed system was evaluated over 19 subjects going under procedures generating solid and gaseous emboli. The results showed that the proposed algorithm yielded 91.5% sensitivity, 90.0% specificity, and 90.5% accuracy. Cross validations were performed 20 times on both the proposed algorithm and the High Dimensional Model Representation (HDMR) method (the most efficient algorithm to date) and their performances were compared. Paired t-test difference showed that the proposed algorithm outperformed the HDMR method, in both detection accuracy [t(19, 0.01) = 132.2073, p < 0.01] and sensitivity [t(19, 0.01) = 131.4676, p < 0.01] at 90.0% specificity, suggesting promising potential as a medical support system in ES monitoring of various clinical settings.
