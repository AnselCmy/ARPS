Abstract：
Intelligent control systems based on fuzzy systems and neural networks have been well proved that can improve the robustness and control accuracy of servo motor drives under uncertainty conditions including parameter variations and external disturbance. In this talk, various intelligent control systems including Recurrent Fuzzy Neural Network, Sugeno Type Fuzzy Neural Network, Function Link Radial Basis Function Network, PID Neural Network and TSK Fuzzy Neural Network will be introduced to improve the control performance of various motor drive systems and applications.
