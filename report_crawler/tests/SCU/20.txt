Abstract：
We are experiencing an unprecedented evolution of deep learning techniques. As a holy grail of Artificial Intelligence, the task of connecting vision and language perhaps gains the most appreciable benefits in recent years. For example, today’s machines are able to outperform humans in large-scale visual recognition, describe or answer questions about an image/video in natural language; and none of the above is thinkable just a decade ago. In this talk, I will first provide a brief retrospect of the progress of the connection in the pre- and current deep learning era. Then, I will introduce our recent works in addressing what is missing in the state-of-the-art paradigm, including the groundings of open-vocabulary, social networks, and deeper scene understanding. At last, several interesting future research directions are discussed.
