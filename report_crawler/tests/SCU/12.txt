Biography：
Shun-Feng Su received the B.S. degree in electrical engineering, in 1983, from Taiwan University, Taiwan and the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in electrical engineering, in 1989 and 1991, respectively, from Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN.He is now a Chair Professor of the Department of Electrical Engineering, Taiwan University of Science and Technology, Taiwan. He is an IEEE Fellow and CACS fellow. He has published more than 200 refereed journal and conference papers in the areas of robotics, intelligent control, fuzzy systems, neural networks, and non-derivative optimization. His current research interests include computational intelligence, machine learning, virtual reality simulation, intelligent transportation systems, smart home, robotics, and intelligent control. Dr. Su is very active in various inter /domestic professional societies. He is now the president of the Inter Fuzzy Systems Association. He now is also in the Boards of Governors of IEEE Systems, Man, and Cybernetics Society and act as the Young Professionals subcommittee chair. He also serves as a board member of various academic societies. Dr. Su also acted as General Chair, Program Chair, or various positions for many inter and domestic conferences. Dr. Su currently serves as Associate editors of IEEE Transactions on Cybernetics, IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems, and IEEE Access, a subject editor (Electrical Engineering) of the Journal of the Chinese Institute of Engineers, and the Editor-in-Chief of Inter Journal of Fuzzy Systems.  

Abstract：
Intelligent control is a promising way of control design in recent decades. Intelligent control design usually needs some knowledge of the system considered. However, such knowledge usually may not be available. Learning becomes an important mechanism for acquiring such knowledge. Learning control seems a good idea for control design for unknown or uncertain systems. To learn controllers is always a good idea, but somehow like a dream. It is because learning is to learn from something. But when there is no good controller, where to learn from? Nevertheless, there still exist approaches, such as adaptive fuzzy control, that can facilitate such an idea. It is called performance based learning (reinforcement learning and Lyapunov stability). This talk is to discuss fundamental ideas and problems in one learning controller -- adaptive fuzzy control. Some deficits of such an approach are discussed. The idea is simple and can be extended to various learning mechanisms. In fact, such an idea can also be employed in various learning control schemes. If you want to use such kind of approaches, those issues must be considered in your study.
