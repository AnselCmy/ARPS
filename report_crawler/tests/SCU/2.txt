Abstract：
The rapid development of technologies in sensing, wireless communication, IoT, etc. has made it possible to build a smart and connected environment of systems, objects, data, and people for a better living in the city. This talk will introduce our data driven research experiences in building data and sensing systems for smart urban transportation in the city of Singapore. With the help of the status data from 21,000+ taxis as well as transit trip data from millions of local commuters, we have been working on accurate traffic estimation, urban transport optimization, understanding transit system resilience, etc. We further develop complementary solutions of crowd sensing and jointly study the data and sensing systems.
