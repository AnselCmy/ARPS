Biography：
Dr Xiaoying Gao is a senior lecturer at Victoria University of Wellington, New Zealand. She received the PhD degree from the University of Melbourne, Australia in 2000. Her research interests are in the area of text mining, documents clustering, Web search, recommender systems and opinion mining.

Abstract：
Text is typically represented as bag-of-words in most computer systems and this talk will discuss why this is "wrong". I will introduce our new text representation methods based on word semantic relatedness and how they can be used in query expansion and web page clustering. This talk is based on the work done by my three PhD students. I will talk about some open research questions, the lessons we have learnt and the main challenges we are facing. Hopefully this talk will motivate more students to work in this area.
