Abstract：
Recent advances in Artificial Intelligence have fundamentally changed our beliefs about what a machine can do. AI systems now outperform humans on a number of intellectually challenging tasks. However, one of the most important features of human intelligence is still missing in most existing AI systems: the ability of general problem solving that would enable systems to handle new tasks without human intervention. Building autonomous systems with this cognitive ability is still a grand challenge for AI research. This talk outlines how the research on General Game Playing could lead to a solution to the challenge.
