Biography：
Dr. Yu Pei is now an assistant professor at the Department of Computing in The Hong Kong Polytechnic University. Dr. Pei received his B. S. degree in Computer Science in 1999 and his first PhD degree in Engineering Science in 2004, both from Nanjing University. From 2004 to 2009, he was an assistant professor at the Faculty of Information Technology, Macau University of Science and Technology. In 2015, he obtained his second PhD in Computer Science from ETH Zurich, Switzerland. Dr. Pei's primary research goals are aimed at facilitating the production of high quality software systems in the real world. His future research plans are directed towards advancing the techniques to automatically test and repair software systems developed in mainstream programming languages and providing tool support for their practical application. 

Abstract：
Program bugs are notoriously expensive, tedious, and time-consuming to find and correct, leaving programmers in dire need of help in manual testing and debugging. To improve programmer productivity and software quality, encouraging progress has been made in the past few years to automate the tasks. Particularly, researchers have developed techniques to automatically generate tests to find bugs and propose fixes to those bugs. In this talk, I will present techniques that programmers could use to automatically detect and remove bugs in programs with contracts. Contracts consist of assertions that specify the mutual obligations and benefits between components like methods and classes, and they enable our techniques to function in a fully automatic fashion and produce quality results
