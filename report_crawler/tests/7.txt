报告题目：Joint Topic-Semantic-aware Social Recommendation for Online Voting
报告摘要:
Online voting is an emerging feature in social networks, in which users can express their attitudes toward various issues and show their unique interest. Online voting imposes new challenges on recommendation, because the propagation of votings heavily depends on social network structure as well as content of votings. In this work, we investigate how to utilize these two factors in a comprehensive manner when doing voting recommendation. First, due to the fact that existing text mining methods such as topic model and semantic model cannot well process the content of votings which is typically short and ambiguous, we propose a novel Topic Enhanced Word Embedding (TEWE) method to learn word and document representation by jointly considering their topics and semantics. Then we propose our Joint Topic-Semantic-aware social Matrix Factorization (JTS-MF) model for voting recommendation. JTS-MF model calculates similarity among users and votings by combining their TEWE representation and structural information of social networks, and preserves this topic-semantic-social similarity during matrix factorization. To evaluate the performance of TEWE representation as well as JTS-MF model, we conduct extensive experiments on real online voting dataset. The results prove the effectiveness of our approach against several state-of-the-art baselines.
