Biography：
Qing BAO received the BSc degree in the Department of Computer Science and Technology from East China Normal University and the PhD degree in the Department of Computer Science from Hong Kong Baptist University, in 2011 and 2016 respectively. Her research interests include data mining and social network analysis. And she has published several papers in the IEEE/WIC/ACM International Conference on Web Intelligence (WI), the International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence (IJCAI), and the IEEE Transactions on Cybernetics. She has received the best student paper award in the 2013 IEEE/WIC/ACM International Conference on Web Intelligence. During her undergraduate study, she has received the National Scholarship in 2009 and 2010, the First-class in the 2nd Programming Contest of East China Normal University in 2009 and the Bronze Medal in the ACM/ICPC Asia Invitational Programming Contest in 2010.
Wen WU is a Ph.D candidate in Computer Science at Hong Kong Baptist University under the supervision of Dr. Li Chen. She has received both her B.Eng degree in Computer Science and Technology and M.Eng degree in Computer Software and Theory (guided by Prof. Liang He) from East China Normal University, in 2011 and 2014 respectively. Her research interests contain recommender systems, data mining, human-computer interaction and social network. Recently, she mainly focuses on creating personality-based recommender systems in various Web domains, including online education (MOOCs), e-commerce, and social networking. During her study of Ph.D and master degree, she has authored and co-authored some papers in premier international conferences (Google scholar citation is 44, till September, 2016), such as ACM CHI (2013), ACM HYPERTEXT (2013), UMAP (2015 & 2016), and ICCBR (2016). She has received best student paper in the Conference on User Modeling, Adaptation and Personalization (UMAP 2015). Besides that, in Hong Kong Baptist University, she has been received the excellent teaching assistant performance award, research honorable mention award and best presentation award of postgraduate research symposium. In East China Normal University, she has been awarded as Shanghai outstanding graduate, school outstanding student, and received graduate national scholarship and undergraduate scholarship.
William K. CHEUNG is currently the Associate Head and an Associate Professor in the Department of Computer Science, Hong Kong Baptist University. He is also Associate Director of the Centre for Health Informatics, HKBU. He received the BSc and MPhil degrees in electronic engineering from The Chinese University of Hong Kong and the PhD degree in computer science from The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology. He has served as the cochair and/or program committee members of a number of international conferences as well as guest editors of journals in areas including artificial intelligence, Web intelligence, data mining, Web services, e-commerce technologies, and health informatics. His papers appear in TPAMI, TKDE, TCYB, IJCAI, AAAI, ICML, ICDM, etc. He is currently the Managing Editor of the IEEE Intelligent Informatics Bulletin. His research interests include artificial intelligence and machine learning, as well as their applications to collaborative filtering, social network analysis, health data analytics, web/text/network data mining, distributed and privacy-preserving data mining, among others.


Abstract：
Enabled by unprecedented amounts of data streaming from all aspects of our lives, Artificial Intelligence has evolved from a nice-to-have add-on to now a must-to-have component in many mission-critical systems for a large variety of applications. In this talk, we first present an overview of the latest research focus of the computational intelligence research group at HKBU related to healthcare and social media analytics. Application domains cover epidemic prediction, daily routine analysis in smart homes, information diffusion modeling, social network alignment, recommender systems, and drug review analysis. Then, we will present two specific research projects reported at IJCAI'16 and UMAP'15, and followed by a glance of some interesting research challenges as our future work.
