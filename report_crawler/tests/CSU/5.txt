Abstract：
Coupled with the massive social multimedia data and mobile visual search applications, techniques towards large-scale visual search and recognition are emerging. With the development of local invariant visual features and great success in deep learning, recent decade has witnessed the fast advance of large-scale image search. Current state-of-the-art image search algorithms and systems are motivated by the classic bag-of-visual-words model and the scalable index structure, and further powered by the deep learning techniques.  Generally, an image search system is involved with several key modules, including feature representation, visual codebook construction, feature quantization, index strategy, and scoring scheme. Besides, post-processing techniques, such as geometric verification, query expansion and multi-modal fusion, can be plugged in to boost the retrieval performance.
In the first part of the talk, I will introduce those related works in each module as mentioned above and discuss the key research problems. In the second part, I will introduce our research work on large scale image search. We have done comprehensive work on feature representation, feature quantization, scalable indexing, spatial verification, et al. Several representative works (i.e., fast geometric verification, a novel co-indexing scheme, and codebook-training-free strategy, recent work in image retrieval with deep learning) will be discussed and the related demos will be shown. In the third part, I will discuss the potential research directions and promising applications on large scale image search.
