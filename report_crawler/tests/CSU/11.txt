Abstract：
Emotions are a central part of human communication, play an important role in everyday social life, and should have a key role in human-computer interactions (HCI). Emotions are complicated. Sometimes, people intentionally express their emotions to help deliver the messages and sometimes people would suppress their emotions for different reasons. This talk introduces the work towards reading emotions, by analyzing expressed facial expression, spotting and recognizing suppressed micro-expressions, and estimating bio-signals from remote cameras, and discusses the open problems in this area.
