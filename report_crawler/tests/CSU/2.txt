Abstract：
The success of DNA sequencing techniques makes the number of known protein sequences far exceeds that of structurally and/or functionally known proteins. Traditional experimental protein structure and function determination techniques are often too expensive and slow to meet with the increasing requirements of genome-wide research, and furthermore, do not work for all proteins. Development of accurate structure and function modeling algorithms represents an efficient, and probably the only solution to the problem. Following the “sequence-to-structure-to-function” paradigm, we have developed the I-TASSER pipeline for automated protein structure prediction and structure-based function annotation. Over the last decade, I-TASSER has been consistently ranked as No. 1 method for protein structure prediction in the 7-12th community-wide CASP (Critical Assessment of protein Structure Prediction) experiments. The COFACTOR and COACH methods, both included in the I-TASSER pipeline, have demonstrated considerable success in community-wide ligand-binding site predictions and been ranked as the top function annotation methods in the 9-10th CASP and the CAMEO (Continuous Automated Model Evaluation) experiments, respectively. These results demonstrated the significant advantage of the I-TASSER pipeline over other state-of-the-art methods, which are now ready for use in genome-wide protein structure and function prediction.
