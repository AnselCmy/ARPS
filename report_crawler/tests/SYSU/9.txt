Abstract：
3D scene understanding is an important and challenging task in computer vision with many applications such as autonomous driving, robotics, surveillance and telepresence. With the help of deep learning technology, the performance of 3D scene understanding has been greatly advanced. In this talk, I will introduce some of our recent works along this line such as multi-model feature fusion frameworks for RGB-D object recognition, RGB-D scene classification and RGB-D action recognition as well as our very recent work on learning based 3D face reconstruction.
