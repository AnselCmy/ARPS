Abstract：
The main objective of our research is to explore the potential of supervised machine learning in face-induced social cognition, riding on the momentum of much heralded successes of face processing, analysis and recognition on the tasks of biometric-based identification.  We present a case study of automated statistical inference on sociopsychological perceptions of female faces controlled for race, attractiveness, age and nationality.  Our empirical evidences point to the possibility of training machine learning algorithms, using annotated face images in the Internet, to predict the first impression of a non-acquaintance in terms of personality traits and demeanors.  In addition, we also developed new techniques for enlarging the sample set of annotated face images by an order of magnitude and for protecting the privacy of subjects in scientific studies.
