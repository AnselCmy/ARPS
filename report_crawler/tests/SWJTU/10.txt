Biography：
Before joining the University of Nottingham Ningbo China, Dr C. F. Kwong has an at least 15 years teaching experience in higher education mostly in the areas of mobile and satellite communications. His research interest includes the heterogeneous networks, mobility management for LTE and 5G, and published a number of publications in journal and conferences in this field.
	Dr Kwong is an active member of the IET, having elected as a Chairman of the IET Malaysia Network Young Professional Section from 2008 to 2010 and a committee member of the IET Malaysia Local Network since 2008. His highest position in the IET was being elected as a member of the IET Council for a three-year term from 2011 to 2014. Dr Kwong also a Professional Review Interviewer (PRI) on behalf of the IET, interviewing Chartered Engineer and Incorporated Engineer candidates.
	

Abstract：
With the eventual departure of 3rd Generation (3G) cellular technology and the introduction of 3GPP's Long Term Evolution (LTE) and LTE-Advanced, the ability to connect is no longer the main driving force for today’s mobile communication networks. Instead, reliable connections with a wide range of services offered and higher data speed has become the essential part of mobile technology design today. Laterally, this has increased the size, bandwidth requirements and complexity of the cellular networks, leading to more complex mobility management systems. In order to keep the operational expenditure (OPEX) at a minimum and at the same time provide quality service to the consumers in a complex system, the mobility management protocols need to be robust and autonomous. The “self-manage” system can also provide “quick-fixes” for any unforeseeable problems after the deployment stage which in turn reduces the need for constant human participation in the optimisation process. In LTE, such autonomous systems are embedded in the concept of self-healing, self-configuration or self-optimisation which is collectively known as self-organising networks (SONs). SONs offer plug-and-play functionality for both deployment and operational maintenance of eNodeBs (eNB) and user equipment (UE). This work focuses on the design of handover algorithms that will improve the handover decision-making process and at the same time provide the flexibility to change performance indicators when the need arises. It will incorporate the training capability derived from the artificial neural networks to tune the fuzzy logic controller to achieve at least a near-optimal output. With this adaptive capability, the algorithms can minimise the need for human intervention during initial deployment, optimisation and maintenance of network elements.
