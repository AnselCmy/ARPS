Biography：
Shihong Huang is a Professor in
the Department of Computer & Electrical Engineering and Computer Science
(CEECS) at Florid Atlantic University (FAU). She received her M.Sc. and Ph.D.
in Computer Science from University of California, Riverside. Her research is
broadly in software engineering and specifically in self-adaptive systems,
brain computer interaction (BCI), health informatics, and computer applications
in clinical and therapeutic fields. Her work on nursing knowledge management
was granted a U.S. Patent in 2014. She was the General Chair of the 24th ACM International Conference on Design of Communication (SIGDOC 2006), and is
Program Co-Chair of the 9th IEEE International Symposium on Web Site
Evolution (WSE 2007). She is a core contributor to the 2014 OMG standard
“Essence—Kernel and Language for Software Engineering Methods.”
	

Abstract：
Although self-adaptive systems
try to automate operation and reconfiguration, many such systems can benefit
from human involvement in the adaptation process. For such “human-in-the-loop”
adaptive systems, a critical challenge is to determine whether, when and how to
include the human. In this research, we answer questions such as (1) what are
human mental states, and (2) how to obtain the human mental model at run time.
We identify neural activities related to the human mental state model and show how
both human and computer can benefit from using such mental models to optimize autonomous
and cooperative interaction. This research represents an important step forward
in the evolution of software systems towards a
co-adaptive era that involves symbiosis of human and computer solving
cooperative tasks.
