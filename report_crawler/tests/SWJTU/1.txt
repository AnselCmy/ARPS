Biography：
Yi Yang received his
BS degree in Electrical Engineering from the University of Kansas, and his Ph.D
in Electrical Engineering in 2013 at The Johns Hopkins University. His thesis
focused on applying OCDMA in optical communication for added information
security. He then worked as an ORISE fellow at the US Food and Drug
Admisstration, and his research mainly focused on laser radiation safety
analysis. Since 2015, he has been an Assistant Professor in the Department of
Science and Engineering at Penn State Abington. His current research focuses on
LIDAR Assist Spatial Sensing and analyzing the system performance for
improvements; applying optical coherence tomography in the field of art
conservation; advancing virtual laboratory in the field of optics and
photonics.


Abstract：
Optical coherence tomography (OCT) has
great potential for the examination of oil paintings, particularly for
celebrated masterpieces by great artists in history. We developed an OCT system
for large field of view (FOV), high definition (HD) imaging of oil paintings.
To achieve large FOV, we translated the sample using a pair of high-precision
linear motors and performed sequential volumetric imaging on adjacent,
non-overlapping regions. Through 3D OCT imaging, the surface terrain and
subsurface microarchitecture of the paintings have been characterized.
