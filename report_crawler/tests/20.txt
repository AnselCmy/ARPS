报告简介：目前的移动互联网还不能支持触觉/味觉等的传输和再现，包括火热的5G移动通信技术。本讲座将从触觉5G（Tactile 5G）出发，介绍通信与计算进行紧密（而不是目前的松耦合或不耦合）协同的必要性，然后给出一种融合通信和计算的新一代移动网络架构（包括移动边缘计算和云化的无线接入网）。并在此基础上给出一个实现该融合的实验平台和一个联合计算和通信的资源分配算法。
ABSTRACT:The current mobile Internet (5G included), though supporting the triple-play services (text, voice, video) well, cannot support the transmission and presentation of touch or smell. Driven by the implementation of tactile 5G and tactile Internet over mobile networks, this talk firstly introduces the necessity of a close collaboration of the two important resources in any ICT system, namely, communication and computation. Then a new mobile network architecture is proposed embracing both mobile edge computing and Cloud-RAN (Radio Access Networks) with the aim of enabling this close collaboration. A joint resource allocation algorithm will be briefly introduced, which is followed by a real-life testbed illustration.
报告人简介：
Kun Yang (杨鲲) obtained his PhD fromthe Department of Electronic & Electrical Engineering of University College London (UCL), UK, and his MSc and BSc degrees were both from Jilin University. He is currently a Chair Professor and the Head of Network Convergence Laboratory (NCL) in the School of Computer Science and Electronic Engineering, University of Essex, UK. Before joining in the University of Essex at 2003, he worked at UCL on several EU research projects such as FAIN, MANTRIP, CONTEXT in the area of IP network management, active networks and context-aware services. Now his main research interests focus on heterogeneous wireless networks, future Internet architecture and its enabling technologies such as network virtualization, software defined networking (wired and wireless), information centric networking, etc. He has published more than 80 journal papers and books, in addition to 80+ major conference papers. He manages research projects funded by EU FP7/H2020 (such as the EVANS, iCIRRUS projects), EPSRC (e.g., PANDA, PAL, DANCER), and industries such as British Telecom (e.g., MOSE). He serves on the editorial boards of both IEEE and non-IEEE journals (Wiley or Springer). He is a Senior Member of IEEE and a Fellow of IET.
