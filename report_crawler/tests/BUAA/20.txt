Abstract：
Smooth Projective Hash Functions (SPHF) were introduced by Cramer and Shoup in 2002. Since then, it has been found very useful for many cryptographic applications. Interests on SPHF have been grown because of its new development and applications in many interesting areas. In this talk, SPHF will be introduced along with examples and some well-motivated applications including oblivious transfer and password-based authentication. An extension of SPHF family is also given to provide linearity and homomorphism to SPHF, which open out new applicability of SPHF. As an application of these new features, a privacy-enhanced encrypted keyword search scheme will also be discussed.
