报告内容：microRNA is a kind of“star”molecular, and serves as a“director”since it can regulate the expression of protein. In 2006, related works on gene silence won Nobel price, which made miRNA be the hot topic in molecular genetics and bioinformatics. Mining miRNA and targets prediction are two classic topics in computational miRNAnomics. In this talk, we focus on the miRNA mining problems from machine learning views. We point out that the negative data is the key problem for decreasing the False Positive rather than exploring better features. miRNA-disease relationship prediction is another hot topic in recent years. We introduce some novel network methods oncalculatingmiRNA-miRNA similarity, which is the key issue for miRNA-disease relationship prediction. Some results revealed that several novel miRNA could serve as the targets or markers for some tumors.
