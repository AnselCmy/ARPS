Title：
Green Networking and Computing:

                         New Perspectives andChallenges within Energy-oriented Infrastructures and devices.

                        

Energyconsumption and the concomitant Green House Gas (GHG) emissions are becomingmajor issues in modern industrial society. In this scenario, current highperformance network infrastructures (routers, switches, line cards, signalregenerators, optical amplifiers, etc.) have reached huge bandwidth capacitybut their development has not been compensated at the same rate as for theirenergy consumption. It is estimated that such infrastructures alone consume 22GW of electrical power corresponding to more than 1% of the worldwideelectrical energy consumption, with a power consumption growth rate of 12% peryear, further stressing the need for energy-efficient network devices andenergy aware routing protocols and control planes. Analogously, the ever-increasingdata volumes to be processed, stored, and accessed every day in modern datacenters result in an energy demand growing a faster and faster pace. Datacenter power and cooling infrastructure worldwide waste more than 60 million MWhours per year of electricity that does no useful work powering IT equipment.This represents an enormous financial burden on industry and is a significantpublic policy environmental issue. Renewable energy sources are emerging aspromising solution both to drastically reduce GHG emissions and to cope withthe growing power requirements of these infrastructures, due to their lowerenergy costs. In particular, the dynamic distribution of computing and storageload in multiple data centers scattered throughout the world can be investigatedin order to exploit the availability of renewable energy sources and lowertheir ecological footprint and contain the energy-related bills. Therefore, newenergy-aware paradigms relying on smart grid infrastructure are emerging, ableto either divert the network traffic on energy-efficient equipment or,analogously, to direct computing tasks or the data towards a site which iscurrently green powered (thus, in a follow-the-renewableenergy manner), or to request to the smart grid a quantity and quality ofenergy (e.g., from an available renewable energy production site) for thefacility (in a follow-the-datamanner). Such energy-aware paradigms unveil new potentials for the ICT that havenot been explored before. The main objective of this lecture is presenting thecurrent challenges and research trends for eco-sustainable ICT infrastructuresand the new energy-aware networking and computing models, protocols,architectures, techniques and paradigms that, considering power usage as a newconstraint, optimize the use of energy and reduce the GHG emissions forachieving a more sustainable society that will be a basis for growth andprosperity. Also, some emerging energetic attacks to datacenters and mobileequipments are presented.
