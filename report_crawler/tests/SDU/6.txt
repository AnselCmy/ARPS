Abstract：
As a class of effectivevectorization methods, neural embedding's exploration on users' historicalratings in recommender systems is still very limited. In this talk, we firstlydiscuss state-of-the-art vectorization methods with ratings for recommendationtasks. We then present our recent work, Preference2Vec, which considers users'pairwise item preferences as vectorization units. It vectorizes the pairwisepreferences by maximizing the likelihood estimation of the conditionalprobability of each pairwise item preference given another one. Then thevectors of users and items can be generated easily. We comprehensively designthree experimental tasks on benchmark recommendation datasets to evaluate ourPreference2Vec method. The first experiment utilizes the movie genres asground-truths and directly assesses the quality of item (movies) vectors. Thesecond one evaluates the initialization independence of the user and itemvectors. The third experiment evaluates the recommendation performance based onour vectorization results.Our experimental results show significant improvementover state-of-art baselines.
