报告摘要： 
In 1953, Shannon proposed the question of the existence of a structural theory of information that supports the analysis of communication networks. Brooks in 2003 proposed the quantification of structural information as one of the three great challenges in computer science.
Li and Pan 2016 proposed for the first time a metric to define the information embedded in a physical system. Given a graph G and a natural number K, the K-dimensional structural information of G is defined to be the minimum overall number of bits required to determine the K-dimensional code of the vertex that is accessible from random walk with stationary distribution in G.  The K-dimensional structural information provides the principle for completely detecting the natural or true structure which consists of the rules, regulations and orders of the graphs, for fully distinguishing the order from disorder in a structured noisy data, and for analyzing communication systems,  solving both the Brooks challenge and the Shannon's problem and opening up new directions. The K-dimensional structural information is also the first metric of dynamical complexity of networks, measuring the complexity of interactions, communications, operations and even evolution of networks. The metric satisfies a number of fundamental properties, including additivity, locality, robustness, local and incremental computability etc.  The metric of the structural information allows us to build a new theory, that is, the structural information theory. The theory has applications or potential applications in a wide range of disciplines. In this talk, I will introduce this new theory and its applications.

He got bachelor in Mathematics in Yunnan Normal University in 1984, and ph D in 1993 in Institute of Software, Chinese Academy of Sciences. He has been working for the Institute of Software, Chinese Academy of Sciences since 1993 after he finished his ph D. From 1998 to 2002, he was a visitor and research fellow in the University of Leeds, UK, working with Professor Barry Cooper (an academic descendant of Alan Turing) in Computability Theory. In 2003, he was awarded the Distinguished Young Investigator award of the National Natural Science Foundation of China. In 2008, he was selected by the Hundred Talent Program of Chinese Academy of Sciences. From 2008 to 2009, he was a visiting scientist in Computer Science Department, Cornell University, US, working with Professor Juris Hartmanis (the founder of Computational Complexity Theory). His research areas include Computability Theory, Computational Theory, Network Theory and Information Science. His current interests focus on network algorithms, and network information theory.
