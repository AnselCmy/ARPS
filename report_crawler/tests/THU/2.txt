Abstract：
Wi-Fi logs from a mobile device can be used to discover user preferences. The core ideas are two folds. First, every Wi-Fi access point is with a network name, normally a human-readable string, called SSID (Service Set Identifier). Since SSIDs are often with semantics, from which we can infer the place where the user stayed. Second, a Wi-Fi log is produced when the user is near a Wi-Fi access point. A high frequency of a consecutively observed SSID implies a long stay duration at a place. Wi-Fi logs are essentially of various information types and with noises. How to assess the information types, eliminate irrelevant information, and clean up the noises within partial-informative SSIDs are therefore keys for profiling user preferences through Wi-Fi logs. In this talk, a data cleaning and information enrichment framework for enabling user preference understanding through collected Wi-Fi logs will be presented.
