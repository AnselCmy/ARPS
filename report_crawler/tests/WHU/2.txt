Abstract：
The important functions of aMachine Intelligence (MI) are able to gain knowledge, store knowledge, and apply knowledge. As withhumans, gaining knowledgecan be achieved by interactionwith its environment. An object perceivedfrom its external world becomes meaningful information ifthe MI can retrieve associative knowledge to interpret the object. The information is assimilated into its body of knowledge if there is an identical association with the information. As a result,its body of knowledge grows in the course ofinteractionwith its external world. The KID model is proposed based on human-like information processing, i.e., a cognitive approach to Machine Intelligence. The KID model is built with three elements, i.e., D for data, I for information, and K for knowledge; three abstract functions, i.e. interpretation, assimilation, and instantiation; and a knowledge repository, i.e., K-store. This talk is to demonstrate the proposed KID model and its applications to retail business and city traffic problems.
