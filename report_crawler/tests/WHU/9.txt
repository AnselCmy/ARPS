Abstract：
The manufacturing industry is entering a new era in which new ICT technologies and collaboration applications are integrated with traditional manufacturing practices and processes to increase flexibility in manufacturing, mass customization, increase speed, better quality and to improve productivity. Virtual factory models needs to be created before the real factory is implemented to better explore different design options, evaluate their performance and virtual commission the automation systems thus saving time-to-production. This foundational concept to future manufacturing allows the flexible amalgamation of manufacturing resources in multiple organisations to model, simulate, test factory layouts and processes in a virtual reality environment, virtual factory design and virtual factories, finally  create the real factory in shorter time, with demand driven product lines.
	There is a well-established body of research on virtual organisations in the services industry as well as on open product design, general service description, discovery, composition, adaption, interoperation and execution. Manufacturing assets, however, are not general (digital) services. Moreover, there are different practices and protocols in different countries. EU member states are also sponsoring national initiatives such as Industry 4.0 in Germany, the Factory of the Future in Italy, High Value Manufacturing Catapult in the UK, etc.  It is essential to ensure the exchange of data between smart machines, systems and software within a networked value chain, as product design shares with all involved parties through ‘‘virtual factory’’, a product moves into and through the ‘smart factory’, as well as to allow flexible manufacturing processes through simple ‘plug-and-play’ techniques.
	EU H2020 FIRST project - vF Interoperation suppoRting buSiness innovaTion, provides new technology and methodologies to describe manufacturing assets; to compose and integrate existing services into collaborative virtual manufacturing processes; and to deal with evolution of changes. In this talk, we will explain the general view of virtual factory to enhance manufacturing integration through the application of advanced IT solutions, how to bring together researchers with expertise in the designing interoperability frameworks for facilitating interoperability on data/information, services and process levels respectively to lead significant outcomes of business innovations for virtual factories.
