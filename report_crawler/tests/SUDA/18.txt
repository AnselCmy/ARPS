Biography：
CHEN Tsong Yueh (陳宗岳) received his BSc and MPhil from The University of Hong Kong, MSc and DIC from the Imperial College of The London University, and PhD from The University of Melbourne. He is currently a Professor of Software Engineering at Swinburne University of Technology, Australia. Prior to joining Swinburne, he taught at The University of Hong Kong and The University of Melbourne. His main research interests include software testing and debugging. Professor Chen is the originator of the techniques of adaptive random testing and metamorphic testing.


Abstract：
Identification of Metamorphic Relations (MR) has long been regarded as a manual and labor intensive process which has severely hindered the use of Metamorphic Testing (MT) as a practical testing technique, despite that MT has been identified as one of the most widely accepted testing methods to deal with test oracle problem.
 A recent study has reported that diverse MRs are effective in detecting failure. Since crowdsourcing has an inherent characteristic of achieving diversity, it is intuitively appealing to investigate to what extent diversity of MRs would be achieved through crowdsourcing.
