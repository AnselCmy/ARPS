Abstract：
Our future life might be surrounded by a lot of IoT devices. On looking at the IoT networking issues, we identify the following features: (i) massive connectivity, (ii) devices generating tiny but periodical packets for the most of the time, (iii) rare event-driven traffics with high priority at emergencies. Traditional random access mechanisms do not fit well for mMTC. This demands for new design of MAC and signaling protocols for IoT networks. We will discuss how we model this problem and propose potential approaches assuming the existence of intelligent edge computing. Our approach can handle small packet transmissions from massive IoT devices.
