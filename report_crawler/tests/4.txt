Title:  From 2D Image Recognition to 3D Scene Reconstruction: A Restricted Turing Machine
Presenter:   Dr. Xiaobai Liu, Assistant Professor of Computer Science, San Diego State University
Abstract:
Computer Vision aims to answer two types of questions - what and where - that involve 2D Image Recognition and 3D Scene Reconstruction, respectively. This talk will cover several studies for solving these two tasks, either separately or jointly. It includes four major parts. Firstly, I will present an attributed grammar model for simultaneous 2D recognition and 3D reconstruction from single view, which achieved state-of-the-art scene reconstruction results on several public benchmarks.  Next, I will introduce how this unified framework can be applied to solve a number of novel problems, most of them are based on moving camera platforms (e.g. Robots). Thirdly, I will demonstrate a vision-based intelligent system, i.e. Turing Machine, which is capable of understanding large-scale videos, like human beings, and answering written questions. Last, I will discuss a few research directions that are potentially valuable in both academy and industry.
Biography: 

Dr. Xiaobai Liu  is working as an Assistant Professor of Computer Science in the San Diego State University (SDSU). From June 2011 to August 2015, he worked as a Postdoctoral Researcher in the Department of Statistics, University of California at Los Angeles (UCLA) He received his Ph.D from the Hua-Zhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China. His research interests fall in the intersection of computer vision, machine learning and multimedia computing. He ever published more than 30 peer-reviewed articles in top conferences (CVPR, ICCV, etc.) and leading journals (PAMI, etc.), for most of which he was the leading author. He has been recognized by a number of awards, including the Outstanding PhD Thesis Award by the China Computer Federation (CCF), and the Best Paper Award by ACM Computing Review.  He is actively working as Technical Committee Member or Reviewer for most of the Conferences and Journals in his fields.  He serves as the General Chair of the AAAI’2017 Workshop on Artificial Intelligence for Automated and Connected Vehicles and the Chair of the ACM Multimedia Workshop on Visual Analysis for Smart and Connected Communities.
